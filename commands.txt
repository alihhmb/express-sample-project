#The .sequelizerc File
#This is a special configuration file. It lets you specify various options that you would usually pass as #arguments to CLI. Some scenarios where you can use it.
#
#    You want to override default path to migrations, models, seeders or config folder.
#    You want to rename config.json to something else like database.json
#
#And a whole lot more. Let's see how you can use this file for custom configuration.
